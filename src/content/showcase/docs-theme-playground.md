This playground explores how far we can push MDX shortcodes and typography scales inside Astro without sacrificing performance. Every component is theme-aware, so visitors can inspect contrast ratios and font usage in both light and dark modes.

### Components

- Multi-column navigation tree that mirrors the route layout.
- Callout blocks that promote custom MDX shortcodes such as `<Notice>` and `<Video>`.
- Playground panel that displays spacing tokens and TypeScale baselines.

### Outcome

The experiment gave us a reusable docs template that we now reach for whenever we need to publish internal runbooks or API notes.
